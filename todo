======================= DONE ==============================

0. different shape of f16 mma kernel : done
1. tf32 kernel pass : lhs ldmatrix passed, mma passed, rhs ldmatrix still has bug

======================= TODO ==============================

4. make one faster kernel, not limit to. (need to pack fragment loading in Matrix design)
*. repack into Matrix : dist_to_fragments, and can be wrapped within kernel, make kernel interface as Matrix (c with float*, will be opt'd latter)
5. add cp.async
6. integrate to choreo // next week

2. add TODO to baseline accrucy : pending, leave to latter dev
3. handle C reuse issue : we fine, we can work now, and not become bottleneck yet.
